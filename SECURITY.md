# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report anything that should not be public until it is fixed **privately**, through GitHub's private
vulnerability reporting: the repository's **Security** tab, **Report a vulnerability**
([direct link](https://github.com/theacidblack/HyperStrata/security/advisories/new)). Say what you found, how to reproduce it
(the request, the config keys involved, the HyperStrata version), and what an attacker gains. Report privately via the Security tab; credit on request.

No version is supported; no fix timeline or backport is promised. Fixes land when the owner needs them.

## What the server exposes

HyperStrata runs a model on your PC and serves it over HTTP (`serve/server.py`). Out of the box it is reachable from
this PC only. The details and every setting are in [docs/DETAILS.md](docs/DETAILS.md) ("From other devices",
"Host names", "Web pages without an API key", "Tools from MCP servers").

- **Where it listens.** `127.0.0.1` by default. `--host 0.0.0.0` (or `"host"` in `strata-<model>.json`) opens it to
  your network, and the server then warns when no API key is set.
- **API key.** `"api_key"` in the run config (or `STRATA_API_KEY`) is required on `/v1/*` and on every endpoint
  that shows the model's state, requests or answers (`/status`, `/metrics`, `/settings`, `/mcp`, `/props`, `/slots`,
  `/api/requests`, `/config`) and on every `POST`. It is compared in constant time. Set one before you open the
  server to your network or put a tunnel in front of it.
- **Host check (DNS rebinding, 0.1.38).** Without an API key the server answers only requests whose `Host` is a name
  it knows (`localhost`, an IP address, the address it listens on and, when it listens beyond this PC, this PC's
  name). Others get 403. `"allowed_hosts"` adds names; with an API key the key decides.
- **Origin check (0.1.38).** Without an API key, a browser `POST` to `/v1/*` from another web site's page (it carries
   an `Origin` header) gets 403 unless that origin is HyperStrata's own page, `localhost`, an allowed host, or listed in
  `"trusted_origins"` / `"cors_origins"`. Changing settings (`/settings`, and `/config`: the few run config keys the
   page's Model settings may change - never the network, key, MCP or program keys), `/load` and `/unload` and the
   MCP tools are accepted only as JSON from HyperStrata's own page (or `"trusted_origins"`), so a page elsewhere cannot
  change settings or run tools.
- **CORS** is off unless `"cors_origins"` lists origins, and then only for `/v1/*`.
- **MCP tools** are opt-in: only the servers you put in the run config, only for requests from HyperStrata's own page
  that ask for them. They run with your user's rights, and the model decides when to call them.
- **The request monitor** (`/api-monitor`, which keeps the last prompts and answers in memory) is off unless
  `"api_monitor": true` is set.

HyperStrata has not had an outside security audit yet.
